Goal of this small project is to learn about [mantine](https://mantine.dev) by
making a stupid troll game.

##Â The game

Display `rowsNb`*`columnsNb` checkboxes, the user needs to click them all to get
a surprise, when the user clicks the last one, all of them is unchecked. When,
he checks this box, nothing happens. Show some messages when he tries to uncheck
boxes like "you are supposed to check the boxes not uncheck them". To complete
the game, the user needs to look at the source code to make visible the hidden box.

## Mantine
